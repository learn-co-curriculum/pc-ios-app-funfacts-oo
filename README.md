![gone](http://www.thefutureorganization.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/disappear-from-search-engines.jpg)

Today we will create *SnapFacts* â€” a cross between Snapchat and our FunFacts app.

*You should now have a FunFacts with a UIPicker that allows a user to select a fact category, and selects a fact from a fact dictionary.*

**Instructions:**

1. Create a Fact.swift file
2. Create a Fact class that contains two properties: content and category.  
2. Create 3-5 instances of the fact class.  Insert them into the relevant place in your fact dictionary.

3. Make a method to make your fact disapear after 5 seconds.
4. Add a fact property that is a link to an image.
5. Make a method that makes the image disapear after 8 seconds.
6. Have your image gradually fade out by adjusting alpha
